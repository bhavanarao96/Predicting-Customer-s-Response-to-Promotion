# Predicting Customer's Response to Promotion

This project aims to predict which customers will respond to the given promotion. There are four datasets available â€“ promos, transactions, train_history and train_history. Promos contains information on the different promotions. Transactions contains details of all customer transactions from May 2012 to February 2013. Train_history represents the subset of the customers to whom the promotion was applied to in March 2013. It also indicates if the customer responded to the promotion or not. This is the response variable. Finally, the test_history has information on the promotion given to a different subset of the customers in April 2013. The task is to find different features that will help identify which customers will repond to the promotions in April 2013.
